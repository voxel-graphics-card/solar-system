# ðŸŒŒ Gravity Simulation in C++ with SDL #

A real-time 2D gravity simulation built in C++ using SDL3. This project simulates celestial bodies influenced by gravitational forces, with support for interaction, collision, and beautiful orbital trails.

##  Features

-  Newtonian gravity simulation between bodies  
-  Realistic gravitational collisions & merging  
-  Planet repulsion if both are small bodies  
-  Click & drag planets to reposition  
-  Fling planets with the mouse to set new trajectories  
-  Smooth panning & zooming support  
-  Velocity vectors and trails for each body  
-  Reset simulation and tweak gravity on the fly

---

## How It Works

- Uses **Runge-Kutta 4th Order Integration (RK4)** for accurate physics
- All rendering and input handled through **SDL3**
- Bodies are stored as `std::unique_ptr<Body>` to manage memory safely
- Zoom and offset logic for intuitive world navigation

## ðŸ•¹ Controls

| Action                | Key / Mouse                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Pan view              | Drag with left mouse button  |
| Zoom in/out           | Scroll wheel or `Z` / `X`    |
| Drag planet           | Right-click and move mouse   |
| Fling planet          | Release right-click after dragging |
| Reset simulation      | `R`                          |
| Select body           | `1` `2` `3` `4`              |
| Increase/Decrease mass| Up / Down arrows             |
| Increase/Decrease G   | `G` / `H`                    |
| Exit                  | `Esc`                        |
